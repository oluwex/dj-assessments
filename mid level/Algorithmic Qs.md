# List of Algorithm Questions

1. Given a list of items l1, write a function that takes two arguments, l1 and l2 and returns a boolean that shows if l2 is sublist of l1.
```python
l1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, "A"]  
l2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # is a valid substring
l3 = [1, 2, 4]  # is an invalid substring
```

2. Given a list l1 of integers, write a function that takes list l1 as an argument and returns the l1 with its contents sorted in reverse order. (Don't use any in-built sorting functions. Write your own sorting algorithm.)
