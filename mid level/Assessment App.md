Your task is to build an assessment web application and API on which organisations can register, create assessments and share with their candidates seeking employment with them. Applicants should also be able to take assessments shared with them.

## Features
Organisations can:
- Sign up
- Sign in and out
- Create assessments with questions as drafts. Assessment must have a preset duration.
- Draft assessments be created as drafts that can be edited or archived.
- Each question should have a minimum of two choices
- Drafts can be activated to an active assessment
- Active Assessments will have a unique link that can be shared with applicants via email.


Applicants that click on link will enter their email, first name and last name first then commence assessment after information has been saved.

Assessment should run for the preset duration and kick the applicant out when the duration is complete

Applicants can resume assessment via link so far the assessment duration has not expired. When applicants come back, they must enter their email to resume.
