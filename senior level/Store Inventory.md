# Store Inventory

A physical store makes hundreds of thousands of sales per day but unfortunately, they still make use of pen and paper for keeping track of inventory, sales and cash inflow.

Your task is to develop a robust and scalable web application api that this store can use to keep track of sales, inventory and refunds. 

## Features
- Sales people should perform Point-of-Sale and checkout functions through the application
- The store manager should be able to add/suspend sales people, modify inventory, view inventory and sales reports.
